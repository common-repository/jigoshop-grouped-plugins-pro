# Jigoshop Grouped Products Pro #

Current Version: 4.0

Yet another awesome plugin by [Chris Christoff](http://www.chriscct7.com)

### Description ###

This plugin allows you to extend the abilities of the grouped product in Jigoshop

Parent Product:

There are 4 settings for the parent product:

1. Add a min number of child items per parent product. Use to require at least X number of items be added per "package". 0=no limit
2. Add a max number of child items per parent product. Can be used to limit number of items per "package". 0=no limit
3. Add a price for the parent. Used if you charge for the parent alone, or charge for the parent and then the child items are add-ons. 0=no price
4. Add a quantity to parent. Currently does not auto-deduct (will in next version). Useful, if you only wish to sell the product as a limited package (first 100 ordered). When combined with Jigoshop's "Remove item on out of stock", can be used to temp/perm remove item from shop.

Child Product:

There are 2 settings for the child product:

1. Add a min number of child items. Used to require at least X number of child option X be added. Not enforced in this version completely. 0=no limit
2. Add a max number of child items. Used to limit the number to one child option to X amount. 0=no limit
